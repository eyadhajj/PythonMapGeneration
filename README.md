# PythonMapGeneration
This is a demo of how to generate tiles in a random order that complies with certain conditions. 

In this demonstration, the tiles are void, ground and wall. Ground tiles are only allowed to be spawned within walls and void tiles are only allowed to be initialised outside of walls and never next to ground tiles.
